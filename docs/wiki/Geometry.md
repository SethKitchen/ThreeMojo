# Geometry

`core/buffer_geometry.mojo`, `core/buffer_attribute.mojo`, `core/geometry_store.mojo` and `geometries/`. A `BufferGeometry` holds named vertex attributes and an optional index. Three builders make a box, a sphere and a plane.

three.js: `BufferGeometry`, `BufferAttribute`, `BoxGeometry`, `SphereGeometry`, `PlaneGeometry`.

## BufferAttribute

A flat `List[Float32]` with an item size. `BufferAttribute(data, 3)` holds vectors of three floats.

| Member | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `count() -> Int` | The number of items. |
| `component(index, offset) -> Float32` | One float of one item. |
| `vector3(index) -> Vector3` | One item as a vector. Item size must be three. |

## BufferGeometry

| Member | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `set_attribute(name, attribute)` | Add or replace an attribute. |
| `attribute_view(name) -> ref BufferAttribute` | Borrow an attribute. Bind it with `ref`. |
| `clone_attribute(name) -> BufferAttribute` | Copy an attribute. |
| `has_attribute(name) -> Bool` | Whether the attribute exists. |
| `set_index(index)` | Set the triangle index. An empty list clears it. |
| `vertex_count() -> Int` | The number of vertices in `position`. |
| `triangle_count() -> Int` | The number of triangles. |
| `corner(triangle, corner) -> Vector3` | A corner position. |
| `corner_index(triangle, corner) -> Int` | Which vertex that corner is. |

Attribute names are the constants `POSITION`, `NORMAL` and `UV`. A geometry needs `position`. It needs `normal` for smooth shading and `uv` for a texture.

## GeometryStore

`assets.geometries.add(geometry)` stores a geometry and returns a `GeometryId`. `get(id)` borrows it. Many meshes share one geometry. See [Meshes and assets](Meshes-and-assets).

## Box

```mojo
var solid = cube(Length(1.0, METER))
var brick = box(Length(2.0, METER), Length(1.0, METER), Length(0.5, METER))
```

A box has twenty-four vertices, four per face. Each face carries its own normal and texture coordinates. The whole image covers each face once.

## Sphere

```mojo
var ball = sphere(Length(1.0, METER), 24, 16)   # segments around, rings down
```

A latitude and longitude sphere. Each normal points away from the center, so shading is smooth. `u` runs once around the equator. `v` runs from one at the north pole to zero at the south pole. It needs at least three segments and two rings.

## Plane

```mojo
var sheet = plane(Length(2.0, METER), Length(1.0, METER))        # one quad
var grid = plane(Length(20.0, METER), Length(20.0, METER), 4, 4)  # sixteen quads
```

A rectangle in the xy plane, facing +z, centered on the origin. The vertex order, winding and texture coordinates match three.js. Turn the node a quarter turn about x to make a floor.

The texture coordinates run once across the rectangle. To tile an image, rewrite the `uv` attribute, as `examples/floor.mojo` does.

## Errors

- A negative or zero extent raises.
- A sphere with too few segments or rings raises.
- A plane with fewer than one segment raises.
- An index entry beyond the last vertex raises.
