## OpenEXR and TinyEXR

`render/exr.mojo` ports three.js's `EXRLoader`, whose PIZ decoder -- the
Huffman coder, the wavelet and the lookup table -- derives from the original
Industrial Light & Magic OpenEXR implementation and from TinyEXR. Their
notices, as three.js preserves them:

## Basis Universal

<https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal>

`render/uastc.mojo` and `render/etc1s.mojo` port the UASTC LDR 4x4 unpacker
and the ETC1S slice, codebook and Huffman decoders of `basisu_transcoder.cpp`
and `basisu_transcoder_internal.h`, with their tables: the UASTC mode, range,
partition, anchor and weight tables, the ASTC endpoint unquantization
constants, and the ETC1 intensity tables. `render/uastc_hdr.mojo` ports the
ASTC block unpacker and decoder of `basisu_astc_helpers.h`, with its trit and
quint tables, block mode layouts and partition hash, and `render/etc1s.mojo`
ports the video frame prediction of `basisu_transcoder.cpp`. The port is a
translation to Mojo and changes the code: it decodes only to RGBA bytes or
floats, and it refuses malformed data with an error where the original returns
false or reads on. Basis

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

## MikkTSpace

`geometries/mikktspace.mojo` ports Morten S. Mikkelsen's `mikktspace.c`,
which three.js's `computeMikkTSpaceTangents` runs as a WebAssembly build.
The port is an altered version of that source: it is written in Mojo, and
it leaves out the paths for quads. Its notice:

## fflate

<https://github.com/101arrowz/fflate>

`render/deflate.mojo` ports the DEFLATE compressor of fflate 0.8.2, the copy
that three.js keeps in `examples/jsm/libs/fflate.module.js`. Its Huffman code
limit comes from UZIP.js, as fflate notes. fflate is distributed under the MIT

## Draco

<https://github.com/google/draco>

`loaders/draco.mojo`, `loaders/draco_buffer.mojo`, `loaders/draco_mesh.mojo`,
`loaders/draco_attributes.mojo` and `loaders/draco_kd_tree.mojo` port the
decoder of Draco 1.5.6, the version whose WebAssembly build three.js keeps in
`examples/jsm/libs/draco/`: the decoder buffer, the rANS and bit decoders, the
Edgebreaker, sequential and KD-tree decoders, the corner tables and
traversers, the prediction schemes and their transforms, and the quantization
and octahedron transforms. The port is a translation to Mojo and changes the
code: it reads bitstreams 2.2 and 2.3 only, and it refuses malformed data with
an error where the original returns false or reads on. Draco is distributed
under the Apache License 2.0, reproduced in full under Basis Universal above,
with this notice at the head of each source file:

The test files under `assets/draco/` were written by the Draco 1.5.7 encoder,
built from its source, and some were then changed by hand.

## Scope note

The `coverage/` directory — the line, branch, condition, and MC-DC coverage
tooling — is entirely original work with no three.js lineage. It is covered by
ThreeMojo's own license alone.

The Mojo toolchain and standard library are products of Modular Inc. and are
not redistributed by this project; they are installed separately by the user
under Modular's own terms.
